# Shellchords
Give it a root note, then choose whether it's a major or minor, and Shellchords will help you start that masterpiece. Scales and chords go hand in hand. They are an algorithm, a pattern. I just wanted a simple tool to help me see what chords fit in specific scales, and the diatonic triads of the chords.
